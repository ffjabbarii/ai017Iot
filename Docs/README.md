This is Documentation portal. 
It will have an index,html which in it we put CARDS, a nice fancy looking boxes that are built by CSS.
Each box has a Title, and an attached html page which is the content of that CARD.  
So to document this system, make bunch of boxes, and have an html page with fnacy CSS explaining tht box.
